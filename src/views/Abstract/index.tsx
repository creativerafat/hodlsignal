At that point the smart contract verifies they didn\'t spend their tokens between signals, and pays them a fixed reward for the days they didn\'t use their tokens. It isn\'t staking because there is no locking up of HODLS and it piggybacks or takes advantage of the POLYGON Network for its consensus mechanism. Furthermore, their HODL Signal Tokens are not locked up in a smart contract, and the User never gives up control of their HODLS to a 3rd party. The User\'s HODLS remain in an address that the User always maintains control of and possession of during the HODLing process.

The Founders/Creators/Developers will also have to Claim or Transform their Crypto to obtain HODLS. More importantly 100% the Cryptocurrencies that are converted/transformed into HODL Signal Tokens will be strategically put into liquidity pools on a DEX so that the value of a single HODL Signal Token cannot go to zero. There are no back door bonuses or origin addresses that are paid to the Founders/Creators/Developers either pre or post distribution. 100% of the distribution will be open and reviewable on the smart contract/blockchain for everyone to see – showing transparency of its initial distribution.')}</CommonText>
