He talks about how fresh water does not have intrinsic value in many Countries because we use it to flush our toilets. An attribute of money is not just intrinsic value, but also scarcity. He explains how a currency with intrinsic value; is not always a good thing. As in Bananas you might eat them.

            <FAQContent>{t('For cryptocurrencies to derive value a few assumptions must be made. This can be difficult for some to comprehend in our new digital economy. In other words, just because it does not exist in physical form, does not mean it doesn\'t exist and doesn\'t have value and purpose (utility). ')}</FAQContent>
            <FAQContent>{t('Our first assumption is that a Cryptocurrency will derive its value both from its use as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. We base this on the assumption that for something to be used as a store of value it needs to have some intrinsic value, and if a Cryptocurrency does not achieve success as a medium of exchange, it will have no practical utility and thus no intrinsic value and will not be appealing as a store of value. However, Bananas have intrinsic value until you eat them. Water might have intrinsic value in the desert, but not in your toilet.')}</FAQContent>
            <FAQContent>{t('To put it simply, value comes from a medium of exchange. Two parties need to be able to transact with it. Cryptocurrencies do this very well in a peer-to-peer environment (smart phone to smart phone) or (PC to PC). ')}</FAQContent>
            <FAQContent>{t('The second assumption is that the Cryptocurrency supply is limited and that has been specified in its current protocol (scarcity). Just like there is a finite amount of gold or silver in the world, a cryptocurrency must have a limited supply. Limiting supply increases scarcity which leads to increased values, so long as it is also used as a medium of exchange. ')}</FAQContent>
            <FAQContent>{t('The third assumption is that the Cryptocurrency gains legitimacy, larger scale investors, and more adoption. This will result in more price volatility.  Volatility will decrease in time to the point that it is not a concern. ')}</FAQContent>
            <FAQContent>{t('The fourth assumption is that the current value of a Cryptocurrency is driven by speculative mining rewards.  Price volatility can lead to many speculators entering into the space to make quick profits. They also use it as a medium of exchange and a store of value while investing in the Cryptocurrency. ')}</FAQContent>
            <FAQContent>{t('The fifth assumption has to do with fractional reserve banking. A true Cryptocurrency will never de-evolve into a fractional reserve banking system. This means that the protocol will not change its total supply that was originally programmed, or the inflation rate of its growth will not significantly change, nor will some form of counterfeiting that is deemed legal will be allowed. Fractional reserve banking is debasing of one\'s currency. It includes leveraging, hypothecation and increasing its supply to the point it loses its ability to be a store of value. A Government that creates a “Cryptocurrency” is not a “Cryptocurrency” because it is one that is centralized, does not have a supply cap, and has too many controls/restrictions of who can use it and for what purposes. Facebook\'s Libra coin also fails this fifth assumption due to its Centralization, its KYC requirements, etc.')}</FAQContent>
            <FAQContent>{t('Therefore the classification & definition requirements of a Cryptocurrency in its purest and true form is it must be one that is cryptographic, operates as a peer-to-peer medium of exchange, has scarcity properties, is borderless, has no restrictions on who or where it can be used, its transactions are permanent (irreversible), and no 3rd party is between the parties that are transacting with it.  In other words, it supports the Human Right of Individual Monetary Sovereignty.')}</FAQContent>
            <FAQContent>{t('All these assumptions to work means that the Cryptocurrency has the following characteristics:  Fungibility, Scarcity, Durability, Transferability and Divisibility. These characteristics make Cryptocurrencies have true value and are a new asset class and many can be used as a medium of exchange and therefore have a classification of "currency" or "money."')}</FAQContent>

For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are alterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.
